- Practice modern web development workflows and best practices
- Develop teamwork and collaboration skills

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or similar framework)
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub
- **Design Tools**: Figma for UI/UX design
- **Additional Tools**: To be determined based on project needs

## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals

Our design approach focuses on creating an exceptional user experience through:

- **Intuitive Booking Flow**: Streamlined process from property discovery to booking confirmation
- **Visual Consistency**: Cohesive design language across all pages and components
- **Fast Loading Times**: Optimized performance for quick page loads and smooth interactions
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Mobile-first approach ensuring excellent experience on all devices

### Key Features

The application will include the following core functionalities:

- **Property Search and Filtering**: Advanced search capabilities with multiple filter options
- **Detailed Property Viewing**: Comprehensive property information with high-quality images
- **Secure Checkout Process**: Safe and reliable payment processing and booking confirmation
- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration, login, and profile management

### Primary Pages

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Property Listing View | Grid display of available properties with comprehensive filtering options including location, price range, amenities, and property type |
| Listing Detailed View | Complete property details featuring image galleries, amenities list, location information, reviews, and integrated booking form with calendar |
| Simple Checkout View | Streamlined payment interface with booking summary, guest information form, payment processing, and booking confirmation |

### Importance of User-Friendly Design

A well-designed booking system is crucial for business success because it:

- **Reduces User Friction**: Intuitive interfaces minimize confusion and abandoned bookings
- **Increases Conversion Rates**: Clear calls-to-action and smooth workflows encourage completion
- **Improves Customer Satisfaction**: Positive user experience leads to repeat customers and referrals
- **Builds Trust**: Professional design and smooth functionality increase user confidence
- **Supports Accessibility**: Inclusive design ensures the platform is usable by all users

### Design Properties

#### Color Styles
- **Primary**: #FF5A5F (Vibrant coral-red for primary actions and branding)
- **Secondary**: #008489 (Teal for secondary elements and accents)
- **Background**: #FFFFFF (Clean white background for optimal readability)
- **Text**: #222222 (Dark gray for primary text content)
- **Secondary Text**: #717171 (Medium gray for secondary information)

#### Typography
- **Primary Font**: Circular, Medium (500), 16px - Used for body text and standard interface elements
- **Headings**: Circular, Bold (700), 24px-32px - Used for page titles and section headers
- **Secondary Text**: Circular, Book (400), 14px - Used for captions, helper text, and fine print

#### Importance of Design Property Identification

Identifying and documenting design properties from mockups is essential because it:

- **Ensures Consistency**: Maintains visual coherence across all development phases
- **Facilitates Team Collaboration**: Provides clear specifications for developers and designers
- **Streamlines Development**: Reduces decision-making time during implementation
- **Maintains Brand Identity**: Preserves the intended visual brand throughout the project
- **Enables Quality Assurance**: Provides measurable standards for design review and testing
